Water Me!
=======================================

This app displays a list of plants in a scrolling list. When you tap on a plant, the app lets you set a reminder to water the plant and then it can display a reminder notification after a selected time duration elapses.

Note: The app requires notifications to be enabled. To enable notifications, navigate to the Android Settings menu > Apps > Water Me > Notifications > Enable "All Water Me notifications".

It's [one of the Jetpack Compose training projects](https://github.com/google-developer-training/basic-android-kotlin-compose-training-waterme/tree/starter).
